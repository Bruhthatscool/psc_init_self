# AcePSC 🎯

## Basic Details

### Team Name: EOF

### Team Members

### Hosted Project Link

### Project Description

AcePSC is a comprehensive learning platform for PSC candidates that integrates study materials, interactive quizzes, Pomodoro-based focused study sessions, spaced repetition, and progress tracking. The platform supports students, mentors, and admins with role-based management and structured learning paths across various exam levels, subjects, and topics.

### The Problem statement

Many PSC candidates struggle with long-term retention due to rote memorization and the absence of scientifically proven techniques like spaced repetition and active recall. Existing coaching systems focus only on content delivery, continuous assessment, and progress tracking, but students are left unaware of their strong and weak areas. Lack of time management support and focused study practices often leads to burnout and inconsistent preparation, especially for working aspirants. These limitations make it difficult for PSC candidates to maintain sustained motivation, retain concepts effectively, and be fully exam-ready.

### The Solution

This platform provides a comprehensive educational ecosystem for Students, Mentors, and Admins by integrating role-based management with structured learning paths. Students can access study materials, engage in Pomodoro-focused study sessions, and raise queries for mentors. Assessment is a core component, allowing users to attempt revision quizzes and mock exams while the platform automatically tracks performance metrics such as accuracy, time taken, progress history, and strong/weak areas. Administrators oversee the platform by managing accounts, notice board, and materials, while a built-in rating system for materials ensures quality control. By logging every interaction—from quiz attempts to mentor verifications—the platform maintains a detailed activity history that allows mentors to monitor performance and students to achieve their learning goals through a data-driven, supported environment.

## AI Tools Used (Optional - For Transparency Bonus)

If you used AI tools during development, document them here for transparency:

**Tool Used:** [e.g., GitHub Copilot, v0.dev, Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude]

**Purpose:** [What you used it for]

- Example: "Generated boilerplate React components"
- Example: "Debugging assistance for async functions"
- Example: "Code review and optimization suggestions"

**Key Prompts Used:**

- "Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication"
- "Debug this async function that's causing race conditions"
- "Optimize this database query for better performance"

**Percentage of AI-generated code:** [Approximately X%]

**Human Contributions:**

- Architecture design and planning
- Custom business logic implementation
- Integration and testing
- UI/UX design decisions

_Note: Proper documentation of AI usage demonstrates transparency and earns bonus points in evaluation!_
